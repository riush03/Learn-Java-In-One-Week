  1. Data Types , Variables and Arrays In Java

     The primitive types
     ->Java defines eight primitive types of data which are:
        1.byte
        2.short
        3.int
        4.long
        5.char
        6.float
        7.double
        8.boolean

     They are then put into for groups which are
     -Integers - this group include byte,short,int and long which are whole signed numbers.
     -Floating point numbers - this group include float and double which includes numbers with precision part.
     -Characters - this group include char which represent symbols in a charcter for exampple letters.
     -Boolean - this group includes boolean which is a special type representing true or false.

 How Java automatic conversion occurs. It onl occurs if the following two conditions are met:
         1.The two types are compatible.
         2.The destination type is larger than the source type.

 Casting Incompatible types
 To create a conversion between two types you need to use a cast. A cast is simply an explict type conversion. Example the following
 fragment cast an int to a byte.
       int a;
       byte b;
       b = (byte) a;

Type promotion rules
    1. All bytes,short and char values are promoted to int.
    2.If one operand is long then it is converted to long.
    3.If one operand is float the entire operand is converted to float.

Arrays
An array is a group of liked-typed variables that are referenced to by a common name.
   one-dimesional arrays - list of like-typed variables.
   How to create an one-dimensional array
      type[] name;
      int[] months;
      months = new int[12]

   Multidimensional arrays
   These are implemented as array of arrays.
   int[][] twoD = new int[4][5]

Local variable type inference
To use local variable type inference the variable must be declared with a var as the type name ans it must inclide
an intializer.
